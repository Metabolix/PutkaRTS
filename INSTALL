1. DEPENDENCIES

This project uses the following libraries:
	SFML 1.6  (http://www.sfml-dev.org/)
	Boost     (http://www.boost.org/)

On many Linux distributions, the dependencies can be installed using the
default package manager. On other systems, it may be necessary to
download and install them manually.


1.1. DEPENDENCIES UNDER Mac OS X

In 64-bit version dependencies are:
	SFML 1.6 64-bit version
	OpenAL framework from SFML 1.6 32-bit version package

In 32-bit version dependencies are:
	SFML 1.6 32-bit version


2. BUILDING

The package contains a Makefile for GNU make. On systems that have
a compatible make utility installed, the project can be built by
typing the command 'make' on the command line in the PutkaRTS directory.
If everything is fine, this will build two binaries:
	bin/PutkaRTS (GUI client/server)
	bin/PutkaRTS-cli (CLI server)

If the make utility is missing, the project can be built manually by
compiling the cpp files and linking them together as follows:
	GUI client/server: link all but those in src/cli.
	CLI server: link all but those in src/gui.

Building with GNU make has been successfully tested on multiple Linux
distributions (also cross-compiling for Win32 using MinGW), Mac OS X and
Win32 (using MinGW).


3. PACKAGING

There are two preprocessor constants that affect src/util/Path.cpp.
There is no configuration utility, so these must be set manually (either
in the source file or with a compiler parameter like '-DPARAM="value"').
Neither exists by default.

#define USE_SYSTEM_PATHS
This makes PutkaRTS use user's home dir for user data and settings. The
directory is guessed using environment variables (first $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
and $XDG_DATA_HOME, then just $HOME/.config and $HOME/.local/share). If
not set, ../local is used (relative to the binary location).

#define GLOBAL_DATA_DIR "/usr/share/PutkaRTS"
This tells PutkaRTS where the global data files are located. If not set,
../data is used (relative to the binary location).
